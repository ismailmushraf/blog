‚Äú**everyone** can benefit from learning the basics of computer science. The questions it teaches you to ask ‚Äî How do you accomplish a task? Can you find a pattern? What data do you need? ‚Äî are useful no matter where you go in life. ‚Äù - ***Bill Gates***

***How it came to our Life?***

It was January 1984, A Man from Palo Alto Came Up with a Beautiful Nice Looking ‚Äú**Box**‚Äù which can Talk. It was the First Personal Computer with a Graphical User Interface named ‚ÄúMacintosh‚Äù and that Guy was Steve Jobs. After that Windows OS came and It Reigned the Market of Operating Systems. These Fellows Taken us to a NeXT Level of Technology Revolution. Now at least One Smart Device is owned by Every Person.

Now, The PCs Became Smaller in Size and Mobile Phones are changed our Lives and most of the People are Living Inside their Mobile Phones. Social Media, Personal Data, Bank Details and Everything is Stored in our Mobile Phones or Tablets or any other Kind of Device. But the Fact is most of the Users don‚Äôt have the least knowledge of how they Work.

If you‚Äôre A Driver, There‚Äôs a Greater chance that you‚Äôll have a minimum Idea of How to Replace a Punctured Tyre. Like that When you‚Äôre a Consumer of Technology you must have the Essential Basic Knowledge about it. Especially, Now a Days the Internet of Things ( IoT ) is also taking our Lives to a New Level.We can control Our Home Accessories from Our Mobile Phones and It uses Programmable Circuit Boards like Arduino Boards.

If it is a Social Media App or an IoT Device or a Robotü§ñ or Operating System. all these Things are Programmed. So if you need to know About It. You must Learn the Basics of Programming Like you‚Äôre Learning How to Replace a Punctured Tyreüöó.

**How Programming will help you think in a Different way?**

In Programming, We Solve Problems in an Algorithmic Way. When We Got a Problem to Solve, We Will cut it into Small small Pieces that can be Solved Efficiently With the Least Amount of Time and Least amount of Computing Power. So these kind of Thinking Help us to Solve Problems in Real Life Also. Problem Solving is a Skill that Every Person Should Have and I‚Äôm saying that When you learn to Program, You can Create this Skill Practically.

When you Try to Solve Problems, Come up with More than One Solution or Come up with as much as Ideas you can. It will make you more Creative Person.

### ***Resources to Learn Coding/Programming***

### 1.Learn to Code Your Self!

This is a Course Provided by Coursera and for a limited Time they are Providing Free Certificate to this Course. You can Learn Programming from [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu) in this Course. It is Very Funny and Enjoyable. I Recommend this One to Newbies.

### [2.Coding Game](https://www.codingame.com/)

This is a Website that Allows you to learn programming through games. it is also Funny. But I recommend this to People already have Experience in Programming.

### [3. Code.org](https://code.org/learn)

This Website is also Teaching Programming in A different way that is Very Interesting. and There are So many Kind of Learning Material is also Available There.

You can Grasp the Ideas Quickly by Learning in this Way. and Also you don‚Äôt have to worry about What Programming Language You need to choose. You‚Äôll get to Know the concepts of Programming through these kind of Learning.

### üëç Reader,

I Appreciate your Patience to Read my Post and I Hope You‚Äôve Liked it. And I wish you Good Health and a Good Life. Take Care of Yourself and Learn Programming. üòéüòéüòéüòé
