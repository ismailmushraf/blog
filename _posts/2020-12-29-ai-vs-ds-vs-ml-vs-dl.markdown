If You’re new to any of these Technologies like Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Science. I’m almost Sure that you’ll be confused with these words and You can clear out that Confusions by Reading this Post.

What is Data Science
	We can Start with the History of Data Science. The Word “Data Science” was first Sketched in the 1960s. also in 1990s A Michigan University Professor referred Data Science as a Synonym for Statistics. 
But when the Data Science become more Popular with a Computer Science Background?

 It is when the Data Become more Accessible with High Variance, Velocity, Volume. ie. When we Started to use Internet.
	Data Science is a field which is a collection of various kind of Disciplines that includes Programming, Computing, Statistics, Analysis, Visualization, etc. It is not Data Analytics, it is not Data Engineering, but it is a Collection of all of these. 
Why Statistics and Data Science is Different?
Statistics is a Field of Mathematics that Deals with the Collection, Organization, Presentation, Analysis and Interpretation of the Numerical Data. 

Then Why Data Science is Important? The Data Science gains Its popularity in the Start of 2000s. The Internet Becomes A Part of our Life and We got So much Structured and Unstructured Data. But a Human Can’t work with these Data, Because of Its size. So, Computer came to help. And to Instruct Computer a Data Scientist must learn Programming. So, it becomes and Integral Part of a Data Scientist Job. So, you can’t only be a Statistician to become a Data Scientist. Although Statistics is Very Important.
5 tasks in Data Science
Collecting Data
Case 1: The Data will be Available in the Organization and in most cases, it will be Structured Data. So, the Data Scientist’s Job is Easy.
Case 2: The Data will be available in Social Media and other Platforms But it will be unstructured and the Data Scientist want to crawl that Data from that Sites and He needs to Prepare the Data.
Case 3: The Data will not be Existing anywhere. So, he needs to get into the Field and Collect the Data. But in this Scenario, He must design Statistical Experiments and find a Better Solution to Collect Data.
Storing Data

There are Various kinds of Data like
Transactional and Operational Data
Patient Records
Customer Records
Employee Records
Insurance Claims

Data from Multiple Databases
Bank Accounts
Credit Cards
Investments
In the Early times We were Used Data Warehouses
Data Warehouses are Constructed by Integrating data from Multiple heterogenous Sources that Support Analytical Reporting, Structured Queries and Decision Making.
But, when it comes to Big Data that includes various types of Data like Image, Video, Speech, etc. The Data Warehouses becomes Inefficient to Store these. So, there is the Concept of Data Lakes came. and in this time almost Every Big companies have Data Lakes that have tons of Data.
	
Processing Data
Data Processing can be Divided into 3 Parts.
Data Wrangling or Data Munging: It Includes Extraction, Transformation and Loading of Data. 
Data Cleaning: It consist of Missing Values, Standardize Keyword Tags, Correct Spelling Errors, Identify and Remove Outliers.
Data Scaling, Normalizing, Standardizing: I will cover these Topics in another Blog (Stay Tuned).

Describing Data
In this Task We need to Visualize our Data to Get Insights from it. And now we have Access to Tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau, etc. to Visualize our Data Easily with the Help of small bunch of Codes. Also, we have to Summarize our Data for Data Analysis.
Modelling Data
In Data Science, We Use Statistical Modelling and we build Simple Robust Statistical Analysis Models that Give Statistical Guarantees such as p-values and Goodness of fit tests. Also, We Formulate and Test Hypotheses.

The Myths About Data Science and AI
	#1. Data Science is not Big Data and Deep Learning. Yeah, there is Data Science in Big Data and in Deep Learning in some way.
	Some of the Myths about Data Science is it can do Everything like a Sci-Fi Movie Robot. Or Some People think It is the AI. But that’s not True. AI is another Field with very Different Behavior. The Tasks that Constitutes AI is
Problem Solving
Knowledge Representation
Reasoning
Decision Making
Perception, Communication, Actuation
I’m Not Going to go Deep on these Subjects, But I can Point out that AI is very Different from 
Data Science. Anyway, there is a connection Between these Subjects, where is that? In AI, Decision Making is Important, to Make Decision we need the Support of Data and We need to train the AI model with Some Data. that’s where the Data Comes in. So, there we need the Help of Data Science in AI.
	#2. Another Thing is “The DS is not always Successful”  If you’ve Data, that doesn’t mean You can create a 1 Billion Dollar Idea from that Data. Sometimes the data can’t give Valuable Insights. Sometimes there will be no Actionable Insights in the Data for Eg: There is an Insurance Company that they get to know from their Data Analysis that People Belonging to Lower Economic Strata are not buying Enough Insurance from that company. This is an Insight But “not Actionable”. They can’t urge these customers to Buy Insurance Because these People will have Other Urgent Priorities than Buying Insurance.
	#3. In Data Science “The Machine Does Everything” Believe is Wrong. Because Human are Collecting Data. To Store Data, He Use Computer. He Analyze Data, Process Data. He Describe Data by Plotting, Summarizing. Also, for Modelling data he needs to Test Hypotheses, Propose Models, etc. and The Computer helps him to Estimate Parameters because Computer have much Computing power.

What is Machine Learning & Deep Learning and How it Relates to Data Science?
	Machine Learning & Deep Learning is a Part of Data Science. Also, Deep Learning is an Expanded form of Machine Learning. In Machine Learning We use Algorithmic Modelling Instead of Statistical Modelling in Data Science. We can use Complex Functions. And we use Optimization Techniques to Estimate Function. In Machine Learning, we only care about Prediction, we don’t care about the Underlying Phenomena. The Difference Between Machine Learning and Deep Learning is in Machine Learning we will decide the Functions to do the Feature Extraction from the Data. But in Deep Learning that job also done by the Computer. Because we have the Computing Power to do so. And sometimes, it gives some hidden Insights in that Data. That’s why Deep Learning is More Popular in this time. To do Deep Learning and Machine Learning We need a Good Machine with Good Computing Power. But to do Data Science we don’t need that much computing Power.
